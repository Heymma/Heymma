## 🌟 About Me
I’m **Ezeatu Emmanuel**, a learner of the **ALX Backend Development program**, passionate about solving problems with technology and building systems that work reliably behind the scenes.  

My goal is to **become a strong backend developer before 25**, mastering the foundations of software engineering and contributing to projects that have real impact.  

I enjoy learning step by step, experimenting with code, and refining my skills until I can build solutions that are clean, scalable, and useful.
